Notes:
To reproduce, replace /home/dylan/oref0/test.js with ~/oref0/test.js, assuming you have OpenAPS oref0 installed in your home directory. Also make sure you copy test.js to that location from this folder.

Editor's note: "Setting temp basal of -InfinityU/hr" means determine_basal called setTempBasal with a rate value of -Infinity. This seems very bad, to be honest.
